## Status of This Document

This document represents a **foundational proposal** intended to serve as the basis for the formation of a future **industry consortium standard**.

ASM defines a **conceptual and structural framework** for personalized apparel fitting, production, and circulation.
It is **implementation-agnostic** and does not specify proprietary algorithms, datasets, or commercial products.

Specific technical implementations, numerical performance metrics, and operational pipelines are considered **out of scope** of this public version and may be defined within consortium working groups or bilateral agreements.

## 1. Introduction

The global fashion and e-commerce industry continues to rely on abstract size systems (S/M/L, EU/US), which fail to represent the actual diversity of human bodies. This results in:

* high return rates in online retail,
* overproduction and excess inventory,
* customer dissatisfaction,
* inefficient use of material and logistical resources.

ASM proposes a structural shift:
**from nominal clothing sizes to a personalized digital body reference.**

---

## 2. Avatar Concept

### 2.1 Definition

An **Avatar** is a **depersonalized digital anthropometric profile** representing a human body in geometric terms rather than nominal sizes.

Within ASM, the Avatar **replaces the concept of clothing size** as the primary reference unit.

---

### 2.2 Core Principle

An individual creates an Avatar once.
Any garment described under ASM can then be evaluated against this Avatar as:

* compatible,
* incompatible,
* conditionally compatible (with defined fit behavior).

This removes guesswork from size selection.

---

### 2.3 Addressed Industry Challenges

ASM aims to reduce or eliminate:

* size ambiguity,
* unnecessary returns,
* unused “dead sizes,”
* overproduction,
* disconnect between body reality and garment manufacturing.

---

## 3. Avatar Creation: Entry Levels

ASM defines **multiple entry levels** for Avatar creation to support broad adoption while preserving structural consistency.

### 3.1 Certified 3D Scanning

* Professional scanning environments,
* Reference-grade Avatar creation,
* Used for calibration, premium use cases, and complex garments.

---

### 3.2 Consumer Device Capture

* Smartphone-based capture (with or without depth sensing),
* Guided acquisition and model reconstruction,
* Designed for mass-market accessibility.

---

### 3.3 Manual Measurements

* Tape-based measurements,
* Statistical and geometric approximation,
* Progressive refinement over time.

---

### 3.4 Confidence Representation

Each Avatar is associated with a **confidence profile**, expressing:

* reliability level,
* regional variation across body zones,
* recommended scope of use.

Numerical accuracy metrics are intentionally excluded from the public standard.

---

## 4. Avatar Size Matrix (ASM)

### 4.1 Structural Role

ASM is a **correspondence matrix** linking:

* body geometry,
* garment geometry,
* intended fit behavior,
* material properties.

---

### 4.2 Garment Description

Garments within ASM are described through:

* three-dimensional form,
* body contact regions,
* allowable deformation ranges,
* fit intent categories (e.g., fitted, regular, relaxed).

Traditional size labels are non-essential within this framework.

---

## 5. Avatar-Based Applications

### 5.1 Core Capabilities

ASM enables applications that may include:

* virtual fitting on a personal Avatar,
* fabric behavior visualization,
* comparative evaluation across brands,
* fit-based recommendations.

---

### 5.2 Retail Integration

Through standardized interfaces, retailers may provide:

* “Compatible with my Avatar” filtering,
* categorization by fit suitability,
* transparency across brand sizing systems.

---

## 6. Avatar Standard Marking

### 6.1 Physical Marking

Garments compliant with ASM may include:

* an ASM mark,
* machine-readable reference (QR, NFC),
* linkage to a digital garment profile.

---

### 6.2 Digital Garment Profile

A garment profile may contain:

* geometric reference data,
* material characteristics,
* declared fit intent,
* ASM version compatibility.

---

## 7. AI-Assisted Interaction Layer

### 7.1 Role of AI

AI systems within ASM function as **decision-support agents**, facilitating interpretation rather than direct sales.

---

### 7.2 Decision Scenarios

When incompatibility is detected, systems may propose options such as:

* garment alteration,
* alternative garment selection,
* deferred use,
* resale or exchange.

All scenarios are evaluated against the Avatar reference.

---

### 7.3 Dynamic Avatar Concept

ASM supports the concept of a **dynamic Avatar**, allowing for:

* gradual body changes,
* historical fit tracking,
* longitudinal analysis.

---

## 8. Secondary Market Enablement

### 8.1 Digital Wardrobe Representation

Users may associate owned garments with their Avatar for lifecycle management.

---

### 8.2 Fit-Aware Resale

ASM enables resale scenarios where garments are matched to compatible Avatars, reducing uncertainty in secondary markets.

---

## 9. Analytical Ecosystem

### 9.1 Aggregated Insights for Industry

Using anonymized and aggregated data, ASM can support:

* population-level body distribution analysis,
* regional variation insights,
* demand forecasting.

**All analytics are based on anonymized and aggregated data.**

---

### 9.2 Industrial Outcomes

Potential outcomes include:

* optimized production planning,
* reduced waste,
* improved sustainability metrics.

---

## 10. Economic Models (Non-Normative)

ASM does not mandate monetization models.
Potential approaches may include:

* consumer subscriptions,
* enterprise licensing,
* ecosystem participation fees.

---

## 11. Adoption Path (Informative)

A possible adoption sequence may include:

1. Core framework alignment
2. Pilot programs with industry participants
3. Marketplace and platform integration
4. Broad consumer adoption
5. Advanced analytics and optimization

---

## 12. Conclusion

ASM is not merely a fitting system.
It represents a **digital infrastructure layer** connecting human bodies, garments, and production logic.

By shifting from abstract sizes to a personalized reference framework, ASM creates the foundation for a more efficient, transparent, and sustainable apparel industry.
